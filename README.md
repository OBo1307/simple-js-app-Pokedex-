## Pokédex (Project for CareerFoundry)

This is a Javascript app, where I use an external API to get 150 pokémons from the list.

### How to use the site:

You can click on the buttons to see the pokémon's height, weight and an image of it. The modal window can be closed by clicking on the 'X' button, clicking outside the  window or pressing 'Escape'. 

### Used resources:

Syntaxes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Framework: Bootstrap
